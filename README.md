## Description

I build this React app to learn about REACT as part of a bootcamp coding course.
 
I learn:  
    - how to create a single-page application (SPA) using React.     
    - how to use React components, manage application state, and pass data throughout your app.     
    - how to use React Router to add dynamic client-side routing to apps.  
    - how to use React Forms.    
    - how deploy to Netlify.    
    - how to use Vite.
