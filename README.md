## Description

I build a text editor that runs in the browser. The is a single-page application that meets the Progressive Web Application criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also function offline.

To build this text editor, I used a started code from a Booting camp course. And I implemented methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. This full-stack application is deployed to Render.
 
I learn:  
    - how to set up webpack dependencies in an application using npm scripts. 
    - how to create a bundle and use it to provide interaction for a webpage. 
    - how to execute a full-stack application with a server and client-side development server.  
    - how to implement IndexedDB inside of a JavaScript application.
    - how deploy a PWA to Render
